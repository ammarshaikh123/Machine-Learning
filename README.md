# Machine-Learning

This repo contains my projects on Machine Learning, I have covered diverse topics under each project, You can see the description for each project below.

1)[Classify Song Genres from Audio Data](https://github.com/ammarshaikh123/Projects-on-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Classify%20Song%20Genres%20from%20Audio%20Data)

This project is based on recommending new music to the users by analysing various components. I have used PCA in this project for dimensionality reduction. For modelling I have tried different models like Decision Tree and Logistic Regression. I have further used Corss validation to evaluate the models performance.

2)[Give Life_ Predict Blood Donations](https://github.com/ammarshaikh123/Projects-on-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Give%20Life_%20Predict%20Blood%20Donations)

This project is based on binnary classification  where I predict if a donor who has donated blood in previous 6 months will dontate blood again or not. It was fun as I got to implement pipelines in this project which was something new for me.

3)[Prediciting Titanic Survival](https://github.com/ammarshaikh123/Projects-on-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Prediciting%20Titanic%20Survival)


In this project I worked on a Kaggle data set (Titanic Data Set). Based on all the features available I tried predicting whether a passanger will survive or not. I was able to land in top 14% of the competetion. I have used XGBoost along with hyper parameter tuning to get my results.

4)[Predicting Bike Rentals](https://github.com/ammarshaikh123/Projects-on-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Predicting%20Bike%20Rentals)

Many American cities have communal bike sharing stations where you can rent bicycles by the hour or day. Washington, D.C. is one of these cities.


5)[Predicting Car Prices](https://github.com/ammarshaikh123/Projects-on-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Predicting%20Car%20Prices)


6)[Predicting Credit Card Approvals](https://github.com/ammarshaikh123/Projects-on-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Predicting%20Credit%20Card%20Approvals)

7)[Predicting board game reviews](https://github.com/ammarshaikh123/Projects-on-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Predicting%20board%20game%20reviews)


8)[Reducing Traffic Mortality in the USA](https://github.com/ammarshaikh123/Projects-on-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Reducing%20Traffic%20Mortality%20in%20the%20USA)


### Few snapshots of visualization I have performed in the mentioned projects.
