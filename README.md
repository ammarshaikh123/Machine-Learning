# Machine-Learning
The reposiotry contains my Machine learning projects done in Python.

This Folder contains all the projects I ahave worked upon on Machine Learning.

I have tried to work on various algorithms like Linear, Logistic, Randomforest. I have also tried to use to some advance techniques like
pipelines, finding the best parameters to run a model.

### Few snapshots of visualization I have performed in the mentioned projects.
